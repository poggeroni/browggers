# Browggers
Browggers (browser + POGGERS) is a stupid browser extension which substitutes every image in every page with an image of the POGGERS Twitch emote.


## Installation
You can find Browggers in the [Firefox add-on store](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/browggers) or download a [release](https://github.com/poggeroni/browggers/releases) and install it manually. It is compatible with most browsers (tested on Firefox and Chromium).

You can test the extension using the `run_debug.sh` script.


## Build from source
You'll need [web-ext](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web-ext) and [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make). Run:
```sh
make
```
Done. Your archive is in the `build` directory.
